Data Type: multivariate

Abstract: Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The
concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and
ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash,
water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.


Data Characteristics:

The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).

Summary Statistics:

Number of instances (observations): 1030
Number of Attributes: 9
Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable
Missing Attribute Values: None
